# Investment_simulator
Investment portfolio simulator for personal use.
This tool allows you to plan the best mixture of assets in your investment portfolio based on historical revenure,
  currency exposre and sector distrebution.

dashApp.py is the main module that generates the Dash-plotly application.

Disclaimers: at this point, this module only supports long-dated ETFs.
  Also the app uses 'front-propagation' to compensate for missing data. (both will be improved in newer versions)
